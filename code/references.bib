        abstract = {The number of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) is rising to alarming levels. Being NEET seriously affects the life chances of many of these young people as they face the possibility of long-term unemployment, isolation and social exclusion. Re-engaging them in training is therefore a priority for policy-makers and practitioners.

This book examines the experiences of a group of young people in the post-industrial north of England attending Entry to Employment, a work-based learning programme for those who have been NEET or risk becoming so in the future. It critically appraises the discourse on NEET young people and its social, economic and political context, and it challenges conventional stereotypes of 'the NEETs' as dysfunctional and lacking aspiration. Drawing on a detailed ethnographic study of young people and the practitioners working with them, it explores the complexities and realities of learning on the margins.}

	abstract = { Purpose: The vision or mission statement of a school outlines the school’s purpose {and} defines the context, goals, {and} aspirations that govern the institution. Using vision {and} mission statements, the present descriptive research study investigated trends in Australian secondary schools’ priorities. Research Methods: A stratified sample of secondary school vision {and} mission statements across 308 schools from government, independent, {and} Catholic sectors in Victoria, Australia, was analyzed using qualitative {and} quantitative approaches. Findings: Academic achievement was the most common theme, with school belonging {and} mental health promotion themes cited by over half of the schools. School belonging was emphasized more often by Catholic schools compared with independent {and} government schools, {and} by rural schools compared with urban schools. Implications: Australian schools are seemingly adopting a dual purpose: to be academic institutions {and} well-being enhancing institutions. Understanding the priorities of schools using vision {and} mission statements may guide researchers, administrators, {and} teachers about how to better meet the academic {and} psychological needs of the students. The priorities of schools also have implications for how research in this area is communicated to schools, {and} this study provides a method for capturing these priorities. },
